This may seem an ambitious task, but by confining himself to the simplest cases and by adopting a proper mathematical formulation, Dr. H. T. Flint has succeeded in producing an essay which is exact and intelligible. The bibliography on p. 113 reveals the identity of a person whose name is spelt Shroedinger in the preface and throughout the book.},

abstract = {This case study describes the lessons learned from an event that saw no loss of life, no loss of property, no loss of financial resources, and no victims whatsoever. The case is a study about the failures to proactively adapt that led to a “hack” on the Oldsmar Water Plant. The city of Oldsmar is located just 20 miles from the city of Tampa Bay, and the event occurred 24–36h before the Super Bowl of 2021, which was in Tampa Bay, Florida, in the United States (US). During this event, a person or group twice accessed a Florida water treatment plant's computer system and set industrial control system (ICS) that the plant uses to mix fatal levels of sodium hydroxide or lye with the water the plant treated. An employee first noticed that the levels had been set to fatal levels and reset them. The second intrusion was observed in real time as an employee watched the mouse cursor moving on its own due to remote access. They watched the ICS being set to fatal levels once again. On the second intrusion, the employee alerted their supervisor and then city officials. The intrusion itself is not of interest; however, eveyrthing leading up to it is an outline of how to increase the likelihood of an attack.}
